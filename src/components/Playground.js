/*
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Rules of STATE ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
  - We create a slice of state like this: `const [healthPoints, setHealthPoints] = useState(100)`
  - A component may have as may slices of state as it needs
  - A slice of state may contain a string, a number, a boolean, an array, an object...
  - We use slices of state to store information that changes as the user interacts with the app
  - State is used in the JSX interpolated inside curly brackets
  - We never tamper with state: `healthPoints++`, `healthPoints--` or `someState.push(item)` is FORBIDDEN
  - We use the dedicated "state updater" to schedule a state change: `setHealthPoints(healthPoints + 1)`

// First: Import React
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Second: Define the component (ie function)
// function declaration ::: function name() {}
// function expression  ::: const name = () => {}

function Playground() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  console.log(count);
  // returns 2 things: 
  //     first: state variable, 
  //     second: a way to update the state variable
  // Third: return....something
  return (
    <h1>Welcome to the playground!</h1>
  )
}

// Fourth: export (expose) our component to the outside world
export default Playground;
